Changed the main game theme 3 times now.
(Started of as a Dinosaur-hunting game idea, then somehow evolved into a massive war between you and iron monsters, 
to finally become what it is now, hoping this time this idea is not gonna deceive me)


Title : [Didn't decide yet]

Game Theme : A vehicle-based game where the goal is to fight in a friendly way with another team using planes, cars, 
(perhaps?) boats, etc... , there will be a lot of game modes (thinking of first-to-the-finish-line races, land-domination, etc...)

Story : [Not currently thinking of any story/career idea; there might not even be any story/career at all]
