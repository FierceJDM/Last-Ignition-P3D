Changed the main game theme 3 times now.
(Started off as a Dinosaur-hunting game idea, then somehow evolved into a massive war between player and iron monsters, 
to finally become what it is now, hoping this time this idea is not gonna deceive me)


Title : Last Ignition

Main Game Theme : A mix of "Racing" and "Adventure" genres. Vehicle-based game set in a open-world (rescaled?) map of the globe (like The Crew 2).

Structure : Organized as creatable worlds, offered in diff difficulties (like Terraria).

World Game Modes:
            | Land-Domination inspired from 'Splatoon'.
            | Paintball-like fight inspired from 'Blur' and 'War Thunder'.
            | Classic races like any other racing game
            | Elimination game "Last one on the road out" based on real-life, driven-by-music game "Last one standing out"

Events(they determine progress?):  
            | Last Ignition (last gas car to survive in EV invasion wins)
            | Scrap Rain (survive in a rain of objects)
            | 

Story : [Not currently thinking of any story/career idea; there might not even be any story/career at all]
        [A world progression should be enough]
