Changed the main game theme 3 times now.
(Started of as a Dinosaur-hunting game idea, then somehow evolved into a massive war between player and iron monsters, 
to finally become what it is now, hoping this time this idea is not gonna deceive me)


Title : [Didn't decide yet]

Main Game Theme : A mix of "Racing" and "Adventure" genres. Vehicle-based game set in a open-world (rescaled?) map of the globe (like The Crew 2)

Game Modes: | Land-Domination inspired from 'Splatoon'.
            | Paintball-like fight inspired from 'Blur' and 'War Thunder'.
            | Classic races like any other racing game

Story : [Not currently thinking of any story/career idea; there might not even be any story/career at all]
